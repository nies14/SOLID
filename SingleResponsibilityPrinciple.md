The single responsibility principle states that a class, module, or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do one thing.

The following code violates the single responsibility principle.

```csharp
public class Book
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }

    public void PrintBook()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Title: {Title}, Author: {Author}");
    }

    public void SaveBookToDatabase()
    {
        // Logic to save book in the database
    }
}

```
Why is this bad?
The Book class has two responsibilities:
- Representing the book's data.
- Managing database operations.

This violates SRP because:
- If the way books are stored changes (e.g., moving from SQL to a NoSQL database), the Book class needs to be modified.
- If we decide to change how a book is printed, we also need to update this class.

How to fix it?
We can refactor the code to follow SRP:
- Book Class: Responsible for representing book data.
- BookPrinter Class: Responsible for printing books.
- BookRepository Class: Responsible for database operations.

```csharp
public class Book
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }
}

public class BookPrinter
{
    public void PrintBook(Book book)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Title: {book.Title}, Author: {book.Author}");
    }
}

public class BookRepository
{
    public void SaveBook(Book book)
    {
        // Logic to save book in the database
    }
}
```
Benefits of this approach:
- The Book class has only one responsibility: storing book data.
- The BookPrinter handles printing, and changes to the printing logic won’t affect the Book class.
- The BookRepository handles saving, and changes to database logic won’t affect the Book or BookPrinter.

Real-Life Analogy:
Think of SRP like a restaurant:
- The chef cooks the food.
- The waiter serves the food.
- The cashier handles payments.

If one person does all three jobs, it becomes chaotic and hard to manage. By separating responsibilities, each person focuses on their specific task, making the system efficient and adaptable.
